  "ceramic.coating.description": "Ceramic coating, often referred to as nano-ceramic coating, is a cutting-edge automotive or surface protection technology. It involves applying a liquid polymer to the exterior of a vehicle or other surfaces, such as paint, glass, or even textiles. This polymer chemically bonds with the surface it's applied to, creating a durable, transparent, and protective layer. Ceramic coatings offer numerous benefits, including exceptional resistance to environmental contaminants, UV rays, and minor scratches. They also provide a high level of hydrophobicity, causing water and dirt to bead and roll off, making surfaces easier to clean and maintain. Ceramic coatings have gained popularity for their ability to enhance the appearance and longevity of vehicles and a wide range of other items, making them a popular choice for enthusiasts and those looking to protect their investments.",
  "ceramic.coating.hydrophobia": "Ceramic coatings are inherently hydrophobic, meaning they repel water. When applied to surfaces like car paint, this property causes water droplets to bead up and roll off, carrying dirt and contaminants with them. As a result, the surface remains cleaner, is less prone to water spots, and is easier to clean.",
